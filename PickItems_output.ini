Pick=GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)|IniForm is a utility to create a Windows dialog, also called a form, based on a file in the .ini format.  The result of user interaction with the form is also stored in a .ini file.  Such forms are thus ini-oriented in both input and output, and this explains the program name, IniForm.  |A distinguishing feature of IniForm is that it can dynamically generate the layout of a form based on minimal information about the controls defined in the input.ini file.  You do not have to specify the location or size of each control.  IniForm examines the type of each control, the sequence of controls, and the initial data they contain, if any.  It then applies rules for sizing, alignment, and placement to determine the layout of the form.
